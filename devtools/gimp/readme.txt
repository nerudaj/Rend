You need latest 2.xx Gimp.

Install pico8.gpl to palettes folder for Gimp, instal pixel-art-exporter into plug-ins folder.

Now you can toy with the Gimp projects under resources/graphics. Whenever you want to export final image, go to Tools -> Pixel Art -> Tilesetize / spritesheetize, use default settings and just overwrite existing images.
