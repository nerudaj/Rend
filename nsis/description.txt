Rend is a love-letter to old-school arena shooters like Doom II, Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament. It looks like a remaster of a game that could be released between the original Wolfenstein 32 and Doom, but never did. It ships with a very approachable level-editor so everybody can unleash their inner level designer!

Controls:

WASD - movement
QE - cycle weapons
Space / LMB - shoot
Tab / RMB - combo weapon swap
Xbox gamepads (and Xinput-compatible gamepads) should work
